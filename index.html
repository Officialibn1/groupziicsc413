                WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN ?
            </h2>

            <p class="lead">
                Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that enables secure and transparent transactions and information sharing across a network of computers. It is designed to create a tamper-proof and immutable record of data, allowing multiple parties to maintain a synchronized database without the need for a central authority. <br><br>

                At its core, a blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, with each block containing a list of transactions or data records. These blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, forming a continuous and unchangeable sequence. The decentralized nature of blockchain means that multiple copies of the ledger are stored and maintained by participants in the network, known as nodes. <br><br>

                The key features that distinguish blockchain technology are transparency, immutability, security, and decentralization. Transparency is achieved through the public nature of the blockchain, where all participants can view the transactions and data stored on the network. Immutability refers to the inability to alter or delete data once it is added to the blockchain, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the information. Security is ensured through cryptographic algorithms that protect the data and make it highly resistant to tampering or fraud. Decentralization eliminates the need for a central authority or intermediary, allowing peer-to-peer interactions and removing the risk of a single point of failure.
